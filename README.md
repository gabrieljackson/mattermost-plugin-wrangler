## About

The wrangler plugin was created to provide advanced message management options. Currently, it supports moving messages, and any thread they may belong to, across channels and teams. The primary use-case for this is to expose a conversation to a more-appropriate channel for even greater participation.

In the future, the wrangler plugin will be developed to support additional tasks such as moving messages to new threads. Additionally, web UI integration will be supported for easier use and non-message tasks could even be implemented.

## Install

1. Go the releases page and download the latest release.
2. On your Mattermost, go to System Console -> Plugin Management and upload it.
3. Configure plugin settings as desired.
4. Start using it!

## Usage

Type `/wrangler` for a list of all Wrangler commands.
